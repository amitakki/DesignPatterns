# Design Patterns for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by Gang of Four (GoF)

Welcome to the "Design Patterns by GoF" GitHub repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing the classic design patterns introduced by the Gang of Four in their influential book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software."

## Introduction

Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems in software design. They provide a structured approach to solving design problems by offering templates for solving specific types of challenges. By incorporating design patterns into your codebase, you can enhance code quality, reusability, and maintainability.

This repository aims to provide in-depth explanations, code examples, and practical use cases for each of the GoF design patterns. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the fundamentals of design patterns or an experienced developer seeking to refresh your knowledge, you'll find valuable insights here.

## Creational Patterns

Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms. They address the process of object instantiation in a flexible and controlled manner. The following creational patterns are covered in this repository:

- Singleton Pattern
- Factory Method Pattern
- Abstract Factory Pattern
- Builder Pattern
- Prototype Pattern

Each pattern is explained in detail, accompanied by relevant code examples to help you understand how they work and when to apply them.

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects to create larger structures. They emphasize the organization of objects and their relationships. The structural patterns covered here include:

- Adapter Pattern
- Bridge Pattern
- Composite Pattern
- Decorator Pattern
- Facade Pattern
- Flyweight Pattern
- Proxy Pattern

Explore each pattern's description and practical code samples to grasp their significance and how they contribute to a well-structured design.

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on the interaction between objects and the delegation of responsibilities. These patterns enable clean and efficient communication between objects. The behavioral patterns discussed in this repository are:

- Chain of Responsibility Pattern
- Command Pattern
- Interpreter Pattern
- Iterator Pattern
- Mediator Pattern
- Memento Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- State Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- Template Method Pattern
- Visitor Pattern

Delve into these patterns to gain insights into managing object behavior and interactions in your software projects.

## Usage Examples

The "Usage Examples" section provides practical scenarios where each design pattern can be applied. These real-world use cases will help you connect theory to practice and understand how design patterns solve actual problems in software development.
